# Machine Learning EDA & Model Training Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning Model Training** using the **Automobile dataset**. The goal is to preprocess the data, analyze patterns, and build a simple supervised learning model.

## Dataset
- **File:** `Automobile.csv`
- **Columns:** `name`, `mpg`, `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`, `weight`, `acceleration`, `model_year`, `origin`
- **Source:** Kaggle/UCI ML Repository

## Tasks Completed
### 1. Data Preprocessing & EDA
- Handled missing values.
- Normalized numerical features.
- Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

### 2. Machine Learning Model
- Implemented **Linear Regression / Decision Tree**.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Used cross-validation for better reliability.
