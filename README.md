# 🚀 Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning Model Training  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning Model Training** using the **Automobile dataset**. The goal is to preprocess the data, analyze key features, and build a predictive model for automobile prices.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset used: **Automobile.csv**  
- Contains various attributes such as make, fuel type, horsepower, price, and more.  
- Missing values were handled, and categorical features were encoded to ensure model efficiency.  

## 🔍 Key Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Normalizing numerical attributes  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generated a **Feature Correlation HeatMap** to visualize relationships between variables  
   - Plotted distributions and trends in the dataset  

3. **Machine Learning Model Training**  
   - Built a **supervised learning model** to predict automobile prices  
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score  

## 📊 Feature Correlation HeatMap  
One of the key insights from EDA was identifying the correlation between features using a **heatmap visualization**:

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – for data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – for model training
